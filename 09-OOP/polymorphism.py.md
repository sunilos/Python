class India: 
    def capital(self): 
        print("New Delhi is the capital of India.") 

    def language(self): 
        print("Hindi is the primary language of India.") 

    def type(self): 
        print("India is a developing country.") 

class USA: 
    def capital(self): 
        print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.") 

    def language(self): 
        print("English is the primary language of USA.") 

    def type(self): 
        print("USA is a developed country.") 

# Create instances of India and USA
obj_ind = India() 
obj_usa = USA() 

# Demonstrate polymorphism
for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa): 
    country.capital() 
    country.language() 
    country.type()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Polymorphism**:
   - **Definition**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows for methods to be used in a way that the actual implementation is determined at runtime.
   
2. **Classes**:
   - **`India`**: Contains methods `capital()`, `language()`, and `type()` that provide information specific to India.
   - **`USA`**: Contains methods `capital()`, `language()`, and `type()` that provide information specific to the USA.

3. **Objects**:
   - `obj_ind` and `obj_usa` are instances of `India` and `USA`, respectively.

4. **Polymorphism Demonstration**:
   - The `for` loop iterates over a tuple of objects (`obj_ind` and `obj_usa`).
   - Even though `obj_ind` and `obj_usa` are of different types (`India` and `USA`), the methods `capital()`, `language()`, and `type()` are called polymorphically, meaning the appropriate method for each object is executed based on its actual class.

### Key Points:
- **Method Overriding**: Both `India` and `USA` classes have methods with the same name (`capital()`, `language()`, and `type()`), but each class implements these methods differently.
- **Dynamic Method Resolution**: The correct method implementation is determined based on the actual object type at runtime.

This example showcases how polymorphism allows the same method name to be used for different classes, providing flexibility and reusability in code.
