### Explanation:

1. **Base Class (`Student`)**:
   - `Student` class defines a method `getStudent()` to collect personal information about the student.

2. **First Derived Class (`Test`)**:
   - `Test` inherits from `Student`.
   - It introduces the method `getMarks()` to collect academic information such as class and marks in various subjects.

3. **Second Derived Class (`Marks`)**:
   - `Marks` inherits from `Test`.
   - It has a method `display()` that prints the information gathered from the `Student` and `Test` classes and calculates the total marks.

4. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - `Marks` is a subclass of `Test`, which in turn is a subclass of `Student`.
   - This allows `Marks` to use methods from both `Student` and `Test` classes and add its own functionality.

### Key Points:
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: Involves a chain of inheritance where a class is derived from another derived class.
- **Method Access**: Methods from the base class (`Student`) are accessible in the derived classes (`Test` and `Marks`), demonstrating the concept of multilevel inheritance.
