Here's the code with additional comments and a brief explanation:

```python
# Example of Renaming Calculations Module

# Import the 'Calculations' module and rename it as 'cal'
import Calculations as cal  

# Prompt the user to enter the first number
a = int(input("Enter the first number "))  

# Prompt the user to enter the second number
b = int(input("Enter the second number ")) 

# Call the 'summation' function from the 'cal' module and print the result
print("Sum = ", cal.summation(a, b))  
```

### Brief Explanation:

1. **Module Import with Alias**:
   - `import Calculations as cal` imports the `Calculations` module but renames it to `cal`. This allows us to use `cal` as a shorthand for `Calculations` throughout the code.

2. **User Input**:
   - `a = int(input("Enter the first number "))` prompts the user to enter the first number and converts it to an integer.
   - `b = int(input("Enter the second number "))` prompts the user to enter the second number and converts it to an integer.

3. **Function Call**:
   - `print("Sum = ", cal.summation(a, b))` calls the `summation` function from the `cal` module (which is actually `Calculations`) with the two user-provided numbers as arguments, and prints the result.
