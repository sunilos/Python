### Brief Explanation:

1. **`summation(a, b)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Adds two numbers and returns the result.
   - **Parameters**: `a` and `b` are the numbers to be added.
   - **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b`.

2. **`multiplication(a, b)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
   - **Parameters**: `a` and `b` are the numbers to be multiplied.
   - **Returns**: The product of `a` and `b`.

3. **`divide(a, b)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Divides one number by another and returns the result.
   - **Parameters**: `a` is the numerator, and `b` is the denominator.
   - **Returns**: The result of `a` divided by `b`.
   - **Note**: Ensure `b` is not zero to avoid a division by zero error.

These functions are basic arithmetic operations that are commonly used in mathematical calculations.
