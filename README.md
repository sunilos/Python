# Naming convention 
In Python, there are widely accepted **naming conventions** for program files to ensure consistency, readability, and compatibility with other Python modules and libraries. These conventions are based on the guidelines outlined in **PEP 8**, the Python Enhancement Proposal that defines Python's style guide. Here are the key conventions for naming Python program files:

### 1. **Use All Lowercase Letters:**
   - Python file names should be written in **lowercase letters**.
   - This avoids conflicts with systems that are case-sensitive (like some Unix-based systems).

   **Example:**
   - `my_program.py`
   - `data_analysis.py`

### 2. **Use Underscores to Separate Words:**
   - If your file name contains multiple words, separate them with **underscores** (`_`) rather than using spaces, camelCase, or hyphens.

   **Example:**
   - `data_processing.py`
   - `user_authentication.py`

### 3. **Avoid Special Characters:**
   - Avoid using special characters (such as `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.) in file names. Stick to alphanumeric characters and underscores.

   **Example:**
   - Correct: `data_cleaning.py`
   - Incorrect: `data@cleaning.py`

### 4. **Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names:**
   - Choose file names that clearly describe the purpose or functionality of the script. This helps when the project contains multiple files.

   **Example:**
   - `image_converter.py` for a script that converts image formats.
   - `email_sender.py` for a script that sends emails.

### 5. **File Extension `.py`:**
   - Python program files should always use the `.py` extension, which stands for Python.

   **Example:**
   - `main.py`
   - `utils.py`

### 6. **Avoid Starting File Names with Numbers:**
   - Although it is technically allowed, it's better to avoid starting file names with numbers. This keeps your files more readable and reduces confusion.

   **Example:**
   - Correct: `chapter_one.py`
   - Incorrect: `1_chapter.py`

### 7. **Avoid Conflicts with Standard Library Names:**
   - Be cautious when naming your Python files. Avoid naming them after Pythonâ€™s standard library modules, such as `math.py`, `datetime.py`, `string.py`, etc., to prevent import conflicts.

   **Example:**
   - Correct: `math_operations.py`
   - Incorrect: `math.py`

### 8. **When Writing Python Packages:**
   - If your file is intended to be part of a Python package, the package folder should include an `__init__.py` file (which can be empty or include initialization code).
   - Package names are generally **lowercase** as well.

   **Example:**
   - `my_package/__init__.py`

---

### Examples of Good File Names:
- `data_cleaning.py`
- `process_images.py`
- `user_auth.py`
- `calculate_metrics.py`

By following these naming conventions, your Python files will be more organized, readable, and in line with the broader Python community standards.
