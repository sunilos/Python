import re  # Import the regular expressions module

# Define a string to modify
string = "The rain in Spain"

# Replace all whitespace characters (\s) with a comma and space
result = re.sub("\s", " ,", string)

# Print the modified string
print(result)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import `re` Module**:
   - `import re`: Imports the `re` module, which is used for working with regular expressions in Python.

2. **Define the String**:
   - `string = "The rain in Spain"`: This is the string where replacements will be made.

3. **Replace Matches**:
   - `result = re.sub("\s", " ,", string)`: The `re.sub()` function is used to replace occurrences of the pattern `"\s"` (which matches any whitespace character) with `" ,"` in the `string`. The `\s` pattern includes spaces, tabs, and newlines.

4. **Print the Result**:
   - `print(result)`: This prints the modified string, where each whitespace character has been replaced with a comma and space.

For the given string `"The rain in Spain"`, the output will be:
```
The, rain, in, Spain
```

The `re.sub()` function is useful for replacing substrings that match a specific pattern with a new substring.
