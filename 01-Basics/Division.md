Hereâ€™s the code with comments and a brief explanation:

```python
# Assigning the value 50 to variable 'a'
a = 50

# Assigning the value 5 to variable 'b'
b = 5

# Initializing variable 'c' to 0 (this step is not necessary, but can be used for clarity)
c = 0

# Performing division: dividing 'a' by 'b' and storing the result in 'c'
c = a / b

# Printing the result of the division
print("Division = ", c)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable assignment**: The code assigns values to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. `a = 50`, `b = 5`, and `c = 0` (although `c = 0` is optional).
   
2. **Division operation**: The program divides `a` by `b` and stores the result in `c`. The operation performed is `50 / 5`.

3. **Print statement**: The result of the division is displayed using `print()`, showing "Division = 10.0" when the program is run.
