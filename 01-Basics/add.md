Hereâ€™s the code with added comments and a brief explanation:

```python
# Initialize variables
a = 10  # The first number
b = 20  # The second number
c = 0   # Variable to store the result (initially 0)

# Perform addition
c = a + b  # Add 'a' and 'b', store the result in 'c'

# Print the result of the addition
print("Add = ", c)  # Output: Add = 30
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable initialization**: 
   - `a = 10`: This stores the value `10` in the variable `a`.
   - `b = 20`: This stores the value `20` in the variable `b`.
   - `c = 0`: Initializes `c` to store the result, although setting it to `0` is optional.

2. **Addition operation**: 
   - The program adds the values of `a` and `b` (`10 + 20`), and stores the result (`30`) in `c`.

3. **Print statement**: 
   - The result of the addition is displayed using `print()`, which outputs "Add = 30" when executed.
