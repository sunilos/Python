Hereâ€™s the Python program with comments and explanations:

```python
# Initialize variable 'a' with the value 10
a = 10  

# Initialize variable 'b' with the value 20
b = 20  

# Initialize variable 'c' to store the result of the addition, initially set to 0
c = 0  

# Perform the addition of 'a' and 'b', then assign the result to 'c'
c = a + b  

# Print the result of the addition in the format "Add = result"
print("Add = ", c)  
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Initialization (`a`, `b`)**: 
   - Variables `a` and `b` are initialized with values 10 and 20, respectively. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, so no need to declare their type explicitly.

2. **Variable `c` Initialization**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to 0. This is where the result of the addition will be stored. Although initializing to 0 is not required here (since we assign it a value immediately), it shows that `c` will be used for storing a numeric result.

3. **Addition Operation (`c = a + b`)**:
   - The expression `a + b` adds the values of `a` (10) and `b` (20), resulting in 30. This value is then assigned to `c`.

4. **Printing the Result (`print`)**:
   - The `print` function outputs the result of the addition with a label `"Add = "`, followed by the value stored in `c`. The output will be:  
   ```
   Add = 30
   ```

The code demonstrates a basic arithmetic operation in Python, showcasing variable assignment, addition, and formatted output using the `print` function.
