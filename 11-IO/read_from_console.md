Hereâ€™s the code for reading input from the console and printing it:

# Read name from console
name = input("\nEnter your name: ")  # Prompts the user to enter their name
print("Your name is ", name)  # Prints the entered name
```

### Explanation:
- **`name = input("\nEnter your name: ")`**: The `input` function displays the prompt message and waits for the user to type something. The entered value is stored in the variable `name`.
- **`print("Your name is ", name)`**: This prints the message along with the value of `name` that the user entered.

This code will prompt the user to enter their name and then display it on the console.
