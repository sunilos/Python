# Initialize variable x with the value 5
x = 5

# Use the *= assignment operator to multiply x by 3 and update x with the result
x *= 3

# Print the updated value of x
print(x)  # Output will be 15
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `x` is initialized with the value `5`.

2. **Assignment Operation**:
   - `x *= 3`: This is a shorthand for `x = x * 3`. It multiplies the current value of `x` (which is `5`) by `3`, and then assigns the result (`15`) back to `x`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - `print(x)`: Prints the updated value of `x`, which is now `15`.

This code demonstrates the use of the `*=` assignment operator, which is a compound assignment operator in Python that combines multiplication with assignment.
