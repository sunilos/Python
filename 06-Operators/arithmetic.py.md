# Assigning values to two variables num1 and num2
num1 = 10
num2 = 20

# Addition of num1 and num2
print("Num1 + Num2 =", num1 + num2)  # Output: 30 (10 + 20)

# Subtraction of num2 from num1
print("Num1 - Num2 =", num1 - num2)  # Output: -10 (10 - 20)

# Multiplication of num1 and num2
print("Num1 * Num2 =", num1 * num2)  # Output: 200 (10 * 20)

# Division of num1 by num2 (floating-point division)
print("Num1 / Num2 =", num1 / num2)  # Output: 0.5 (10 / 20)

# Exponentiation: 5 raised to the power of 3
print("5^3 =", 5**3)  # Output: 125 (5^3)

# Modulus: Remainder when 20 is divided by 3
print("20%3 =", 20%3)  # Output: 2 (20 mod 3)

# Floor division: Integer result of dividing 22 by 7
print("22/7 =", 22//7)  # Output: 3 (Integer part of 22 / 7)
```

### Explanation of Operators:
1. **`+` (Addition)**: Adds two numbers.
2. **`-` (Subtraction)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
3. **`*` (Multiplication)**: Multiplies two numbers.
4. **`/` (Division)**: Divides the first number by the second, returning a floating-point result.
5. **`**` (Exponentiation)**: Raises the first number to the power of the second.
6. **`%` (Modulus)**: Returns the remainder of dividing the first number by the second.
7. **`//` (Floor Division)**: Divides the first number by the second, returning the integer part of the quotient.
