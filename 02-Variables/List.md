# List Example
a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]  # Creating a list with multiple integer elements

# Accessing and printing the element at index 2 of the list
print("a[2] = ", a[2])  # Output: a[2] =  15
```

### Explanation:

1. **List Creation**: 
   - The list `a` is initialized with a sequence of integers: `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]`. Each number is an individual element in the list.

2. **Accessing an Element**: 
   - The program accesses the element at **index 2** using `a[2]`. Since Python uses 0-based indexing, `a[2]` refers to the third element in the list, which is `15`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print()` function outputs the value of the element at index 2, showing the result as `"a[2] = 15"`.
