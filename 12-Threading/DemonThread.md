Here's the updated code example that includes a daemon thread:

```python
# Daemon Threads are supporting threads. They can be created using daemon=True attribute.
# Garbage collector is the best example of a daemon thread.

import threading
import time

def first_thread():
    print("Hello Ram")
    for i in range(20):
        time.sleep(1)
        print("How are you Ram?")

def second_thread():
    print("Hello Shyam")
    for i in range(20):
        time.sleep(2)
        print("How are you Shyam?")    

t1 = threading.Thread(target=first_thread, daemon=True)  # Corrected 'daemon=True'
t2 = threading.Thread(target=second_thread) 

t1.start()
time.sleep(2)  # Let t1 start before t2 starts
t2.start() 

# Optional: wait for t2 to finish
t2.join()
```

### Explanation:
- **`daemon=True`**: Specifies that `t1` is a daemon thread. Daemon threads run in the background and are terminated when the main program exits, even if they haven't finished executing. This is useful for background tasks such as garbage collection.
- **`time.sleep(1)`**: Adjusted the sleep time to be shorter (1 second) for demonstration purposes.
- **`t2.join()`**: Optionally waits for `t2` to finish to ensure that the program doesn't exit prematurely while `t2` is still running.

### Note:
- The `daemon=True` attribute must be used with a boolean value, not a string (`'true'`), so it's corrected to `daemon=True`.
- Daemon threads are terminated as soon as the main program exits, so `t1` may not complete its execution if the program exits quickly.
