Here's the code example of executing functions from inside threads:

import threading
from threading import *

def first_thread():
    print("Hello I am Ram")
    return

def second_thread():
    print("Hello I am Shyam")
    return

# Thread function with arguments
def hello_thread(name):
    print("Hello", name)
    return

# Create a class by inheriting Thread class
class Hi(Thread):
    def run(self):
        for i in range(5):
            print(i, "Hi")

# Create threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=first_thread)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=second_thread)
t3 = threading.Thread(target=hello_thread, args=('Ajay',))
t4 = threading.Thread(target=hello_thread, args=('Vijay',))
t5 = Hi()

# Start threads
t1.start()
t2.start()
t3.start()
t4.start()
t5.start()

# Join threads to ensure they complete before the script exits
t1.join()
t2.join()
t3.join()
t4.join()
t5.join()
```

### Explanation:
- **`import threading`**: Imports the `threading` module, which provides support for creating and managing threads.
- **`def first_thread():`** and **`def second_thread():`**: Functions to be run in separate threads.
- **`def hello_thread(name):`**: Function that takes an argument and prints a message.
- **`class Hi(Thread):`**: Defines a class `Hi` that inherits from `Thread` and overrides the `run` method to execute a loop.
- **`t1`, `t2`, `t3`, `t4`, `t5`**: Instances of `Thread` or `Hi`, each configured with different target functions or methods.
- **`t1.start()`, `t2.start()`, `t3.start()`, `t4.start()`, `t5.start()`**: Starts the threads, executing their target functions concurrently.
- **`t1.join()`, `t2.join()`, `t3.join()`, `t4.join()`, `t5.join()`**: Waits for all threads to complete before exiting the script, ensuring all output is printed.
